# My Portfolio - Project One

### About

For this project, I created a personal portfolio website. This website allows the user to instantly get a feel for the sort of website I can design for them, as well as being able to read a little about me, my experience and my background. 

In the website I have included a link to download my resume so that users can get to know me in a little more detail, as well as icons that link to my social media. 

The portfolio section (although currenltly using placeholders) gives users instant access to other websites I have made and is a conversation starter.

The contact form at the bottom is a quick and easy way for users to get in contact with me. 

### Why this project?

My website aims to firstly provide inspiration to potential clients and secondly to provide a promise that if they seek to collaborate with me, together we can create a simple but bold, user friendly and effective website.

## UX

### Style Rationale 

I wanted to create a website that was bold but also a little quirky (although not too outside of the box).
To create a bold look, I used Adobe Color and searched for a "wine" color scheme which gave me the deep reds, greys and black. the slanted design, the gradient and the hover effect gave my website some personality and a bit of "me". Originally I wanted a light wood-grain background but settled for the darker color through trial and error. I believe the final product to be a clean, bold but professional look.

### Interesting Bugs or Problems

- **Burger icon** - The burger icon wasn't appearing once the fullscreen overlay menu was triggered. The reason for this is that the header in which the burger icon was in had a lower z-index than the overlay menu. To fix the issue, I gave the header a higher z-index value than the overlay menu.
