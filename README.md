# My Portfolio - Project One

### About

For this project, I created a personal portfolio website. This website allows the user to instantly get a feel for the sort of website I can design for them, as well as being able to read a little about me, my experience and my background. 

In the website I have included a link to download my resume so that users can get to know me in a little more detail, as well as icons that link to my social media. 

The portfolio section (although currenltly using placeholders) gives users instant access to other websites I have made and is a conversation starter.

The contact form at the bottom is a quick and easy way for users to get in contact with me. 

### Why this project?

My website aims to firstly provide inspiration to potential clients and secondly to provide a promise that if they seek to collaborate with me, together we can create a simple but bold, user friendly and effective website.

## UX

### Style Rationale 

I wanted to create a website that was bold but also a little quirky (although not too outside of the box).
To create a bold look, I used Adobe Color and searched for a "wine" color scheme which gave me the deep reds, greys and black. the slanted design, the gradient and the hover effect gave my website some personality and a bit of "me". Originally I wanted a light wood-grain background but settled for the darker color through trial and error. I believe the final product to be a clean, bold but professional look. 

### Features
- **Navigation Bar Logo** - The Logo to the left of theb navigation bar is simply to add a bit of interest to the website. This 'logo' has a hover effect and an animation to make it change colour and jump around 
- **Navigation Bar Links** - The links are responsive and take you to the corresponding section. They have a simple hover effect of a white border bottom with a cursor change to allow the user to see clearly where they are clicking and also to let the user know to click the link
- **Landing Page and "download resue" button** - The landing page is a simple picture with a shadow hover effect and a button to download a resume. The button also has an effect where it changes to a grey colour and the letter spacing increases. 
- **About me section with social media links** - This section simply uses a bootstrap card and has social media links at the bottom which link the user to the corresponding social media platforms. The icons have a light colour change hover effect and the cursor changes to a pointer to alert the user that the icons are clickable
- **My Skills Section** - This section is made with icons to outline the technologies I have learnt. 
- **Portfolio Section** - This section is made with bootstrap cards and a shadow hover effect. The cards are clickable although at the moment they link to placeholder websites. 
- **My Experience Section** - This section is made with bootstrap cards and outlines my previous experience
- **My Education Section** - This section is made with bootstrap cards and outlines my previous experience
- **Contact Form** - This contact form is responsive and allows the user to share their details and a message. The submit button has a hover effect where the border disappears and the button background turns grey
- **Footer** - The footer has a simple copyright and is coloured with a gradient which matches the colour scheme of the website





### Features Left to Implement

- **Mapbox** - I would like to add a mapbox so people know where I am based.
- **Real portfolio links** - Once I have built up my portfolio I will replace the placeholder pictures/links with real websites


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - I used HTML5 for many of the basic foundations of my website
- **Bootstrap** - Alongside HTML5, I used Bootstrap classes to create the elements such as cards and navigation bars and to utilise the bootstrap grid system 
- **CSS3** - I used CSS3 alongside Bootstrap styles (and sometimes to override Bootstrap styles) to give the website a more personalised look
- **Formspree** - I used the Formspree API from Formspree.io to get my contact form working


### HTML and CSS Validation

I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.

### Interesting Bugs or Problems

- **Contact Form** - Interestingly, the contact form text turns first white and then black and I haven't worked out how to keep the text white. 

## Deployment

I used Github Pages to deploy my website. The process was as follows:
1. I created a branch called "gh-pages" 
2. I merged this with the master branch 
3. I went to the settings and activitated the gh-pages
